# Clearly not a Dora game, developed with P5.js 

DORA is for:
- D: Disrupted,
- O: Oriented and
- R: Ravaged
- A: Animals

## Installation

You need `npm` and `node` on your __GNU/LINUX__ computer.

Next, install the whole and huge amount of dependencies: `npm i`


## Enjoy or play 

Simple as eating a "baguette" (because yes we are frenchs), just run `npm run start` and browse `http://localhost:8000`.


## Develop

- `index.html` links every js file.
- `src` groups all our game code.
- `src/index.js` is the main code, "launched" by P5.js.
- `src/const.js` contains all global constants.
- `src/functions.js` contains all global functions.
- `src/screens` groups all screens.
